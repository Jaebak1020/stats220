# STATS 220
## Welcome to my repo
Hi there! I'm **Jaime Bahan** and welcome to my repo. This repo will contain everything that we need to complete the course *Stats 220*. From projects, assignments, and other random course related memes I feel like creating. 

## About me
Don't skip this part! I swear I'm interesting.
Currently I am a second year at the University of Auckland, studying Computer Science and Statistics.
In my spare time I like to play sports such as badminton, basketball, and going to the gym.
Here's a photo of me if you're curious.
